This is the implementation of A-star algorithm in cocos2d-X. 

Simple.txt file contains the basic program in which cocos2d-X in not required but the output is not dynamic you have to change the values in program to check the changes.

Other classes and resources folder contains the cocos2d-X program. You can first put the obstacles(black boxes) and then when you tap again on the obstacle that you previously put you will next have to select the starting point and ending point and the along that path the obstacle will move.

Sorry for not writing any comments. Kind of in a hurry
